The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can lead to unexpected results if the units are inconsistent or if the calculation is too complex.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works well, but `width: calc(100% - 10em);` might not behave as expected if the `em` unit is not properly defined.  Another common issue is using `calc()` with multiple different units simultaneously in a way that leads to unexpected results.
